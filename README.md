I've done this school project at Codecool's tester course.

## Story

During the System Test phase the User Manual of an upcoming flagship product is ready for a final review. Our task was to investigate the document and identify possible test conditions and write accurate test cases using consciously selected test techniques.

## Tasks

1. 1. Read the Specification from the Background materials section.
2. Write at least 20 Test Conditions. Define which test technique you would use during the testing of the Test Condition and why?
3. Based on your above defined test conditions, find the 5 most important Test Conditions and write 2 test cases for each. Give a reasoning for your answers.
    - Test Conditions (20) created that refer to the specification and selected test techniques indicated with reasoning
    - Overall 10 test cases are written based on the 5 most important test conditions
